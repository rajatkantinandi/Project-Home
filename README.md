##DESCRIPTION
 Hi, In this project I'm designing hompage for a browser where user can save their favourite sites after login & data will be synced to the server. A preliminary design has been developed which works perfectly on localhost.

##Features

* Adding favourite sites
* Manging those sites: deleting, editing, arranging
* Opening sites in new tab with simple gesture
* Showing top sites from the web
* Google & Bing search bars
* News update based on RSS news source (User has ability to change the source): 2hr interval update or manual refresh
* Responsive design, adaptable to mobile, tablet & desktop
